* Norwegian localisation of Emacs Calendar

This is how I use it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (require 'calendar-norway nil 'noerror)
    ;; Localise date format, weekdays, months, lunar/solar names:
    (calendar-norway-common-settings)
    (setq calendar-holidays
       (append
        ;; Include days where you don't have to work:
        calendar-norway-raude-dagar
        ;; Include other days that people celebrate:
        calendar-norway-andre-merkedagar
        ;; Include daylight savings time:
        calendar-norway-dst
        ;; And then you can add some non-Norwegian holidays etc. if you like:
        '((holiday-fixed 3 17 "St. Patricksdag")
          (holiday-fixed 10 31 "Hallowe'en")
          (holiday-float 11 4 4 "Thanksgiving")
          (solar-equinoxes-solstices)))))
#+END_SRC

But if you just want "red calendar days" and the Norwegian date
formats, this would be enough:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (require 'calendar-norway nil 'noerror)
    ;; Localise date format, weekdays, months, lunar/solar names:
    (calendar-norway-common-settings)
    ;; Show days where you don't have to work:
    (setq calendar-holidays calendar-norway-raude-dagar))
#+END_SRC

Note: the function =calendar-norway-common-settings= changes some
settings that you may have already touched in your =~/.emacs= (e.g.
=calendar-date-display-form=), see the function definition for what it
does.

/I highly recommend [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]] if you want a great-looking Emacs calendar
that works with diary/org-mode/icalendar/howm/etc./
